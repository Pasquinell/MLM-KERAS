# Text Generator with nltk

This code was inspired in the text generator of http://machinelearningmastery.com/text-generation-lstm-recurrent-neural-networks-python-keras/

We have added nltk toos for working with words instead of letters, the advantage is that is that we do not need to modelate the vocabulary,instead, we need to modelate only the syntaxis. The disadvantage is that we moove from 48 letters to 2000+ words in our vocabulary
